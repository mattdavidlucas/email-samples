# PubNub Email Templates

At PubNub, I helped redesign their existing email templates by incorporating brand elements from their website. In addition to this, I streamlined their email production process by leveraging includes and variables using good ol’ fashioned PHP. By doing this, I was able to take advantage of other dynamic elements of PHP, like encoding strings of text, outputting static HTML files, and for loops for echoing JSON content in newsletters.
